The Peer-to-Peer Encrypted File Sharing Service 

Abstract
This project aims to create a solution to the ever-increasing difficulties surrounding the transfer of
exceptionally large files from host to recipient without using the services of a third-party company. Files
we deal with get larger every day with higher resolution videos, and incredibly high bitrates now available
to people in their own homes, transferring these large files around can prove to be cumbersome and
expensive, often incurring costs from cloud storage solutions to transfer the data.
In this report I explore the options available to users to transfer their files, and I develop a solution of my
own which uses peer-to-peer networks to expedite transfer speeds while avoiding the costs associated
with utilising the storage space of a server and implements encryption to keep the data secure in transit.
The report includes the research I conducted, as well as the methods used to implement my solution and
create my artefact.
The report further includes testing and evaluation of my solution, the project as a whole and the learning
achievements made throughout it all.
